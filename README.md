# ephios

ephios is a tool to manage shifts for medical services.
Planners can create events for which volunteer help is required (e.g. security/medical services, beach patrols, exercises).
The volunteers can register for the respective events via a clearly arranged web interface.
The planners can then assign personnel and have an overview of the current status.
Different processes can be applied for signup (e.g. a direct confirmation for an event or an "application" that has to be accepted first).
Around this central feature there are further supporting functions like the management of the volunteers and their
qualifications or an overview of the volunteer hours worked. The functions can be extended at any time via plugin,
for example by complete modules (such as stock control) or by further process types for the registration for events.

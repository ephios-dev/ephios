Preconfigured shift structures
==============================

When configuring a shift, you can choose to use a preconfigured shift structure (see :doc:`user/events/signup`).
The blocks can be configured in the editor, which can be reached from the shift edit view.

Adding blocks
-------------
To add a block, click on the "Add atomic block" or "Add composite block" button. If there are blocks already, you can also
click on the copy icon of block in the block list on the right side of the editor to add a copy of the block.
A form for the new block will appear on the left side in the editor. There are two types of blocks:


Atomic blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

An atomic block is the smallest unit of a block structure. It has a block name and a list of positions.
Each position can also be named and has a list of required qualifications. The position can also be marked as optional.
One position represents one person in the structure. Below the positions, you can allow more participants than positions.
This can be compared to not setting a maximum number of participants for a shift with another shift structure.
You can also define additional conditions for the block, e.g. that everyone has a drivers license.

Composite blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Composite blocks are a combination of multiple other blocks, both atomic and composite. After adding a composite block,
it can be given a name. Then, you can add other blocks to the composite block. This is done by clicking the arrow on one
of the blocks in the block list on the right side of the editor. The included block can also be labeled, e.g. to assign
a unique name to a block that is included multiple times in the composite block.
The composite block can also have additional conditions in the same way as atomic blocks.

Editing and deleting blocks
---------------------------
By clicking on a block in the block list on the right side of the editor, you can edit the block. This will show the form
for the block on the left side of the editor. To delete a block, click on the trash icon of the block in the block list.
Keep in mind that changes will be applied to all shifts using this block.

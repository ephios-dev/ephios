Events, event types and visibility
==================================

ephios understands "event" as some real world event with a defined timeframe
for which you are planning personnel in a single or multiple shifts.
Shifts can be continuous and overlapping.

While permissions are managed on event level, signup settings are configured on shift level.

Responsibles and visibility
---------------------------

Single users and groups can be made responsible for an event. That allows them to edit event details,
shift settings and do the disposition for the event's shifts.

Events are made visible for groups of users. Visibility is required for participants to view and
sign up for the event. You can manually add users to shifts. These users, as well as everyone who
ever singed up or declined for any of the event's shifts will continue to have visibility permission
even if you change the visibility settings later on.

Event types
-----------

Event types are used for organizing events into different categories. They can be used in filters
and come with defaults for visibility and responsibility settings.

Settings
--------

You can configure event title, location and a rich text description.

Shifts have a start and end time, a meetup time as well as settings for how signup works.

Plugins might provide additional stettings on shift or event level.

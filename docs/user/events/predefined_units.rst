Preconfigured units
===================

When configuring a shift, you can choose to use the preconfigured units
structure (see :doc:`signup`). The units can be configured in the editor,
which can be reached from the shift edit view.

Adding units
------------
To add a unit, click on the "Add basic unit" or "Add composite unit" button.
If there are units already, you can also click on the copy icon of the unit in
the unit list editor to create a copy. A form for the new unit will appear.
There are two types of units:

Basic units
^^^^^^^^^^^

A basic unit is the smallest element of a unit structure.
It has a name and a list of positions.
Each position can also be named and has a list of required qualifications.
The position can also be marked as optional.
One position represents one person in the structure.
Below the positions, you can allow more participants than positions.
This can be compared to not setting a maximum number of participants for a shift
with another shift structure.
You can also define additional conditions for the unit, e.g. that everyone has a drivers license.

Composite units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Composite units are a combination of multiple other units, both atomic or composite.
After adding a composite unit, it can be given a name.
Then, you can add other units to the composite unit by clicking the arrow on one
of the units in the unit list. The included subunit can also be labeled, e.g. to assign
a unique name to a type of unit that is included multiple times in the composite block.
The composite unit can also have additional conditions in the same way as basic units.

Editing and deleting blocks
---------------------------
By clicking on a unit in the unit list, you can edit the units. This will show the form
for the unit in the editor. To delete a unit, click on the trash icon of the unit
in the list. Keep in mind that changes will be applied to all shifts using this unit.

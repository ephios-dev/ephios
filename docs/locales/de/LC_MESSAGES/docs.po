"If you have an idea for new feature you should start by deciding whether "
"you want to write a plugin (see :doc:`plugins/index`) or to contribute "
"the feature to the ephios core code. A plugin is usually suitable if the "
"feature is very specific to a small set of users (e.g. a specific signup "
"process only used in your local organisation) or the feature is not "
"related to the core tasks of ephios (e.g. a system for stock management)."
" If all ephios users could profit from your feature, you should consider "
"contributing it to the core code. Please start by describing your feature"
" in a new issue in the GitHub repository to coordinate the extent with "
"us. When working on existing issues, please assign yourself and create a "
"pull request early on."

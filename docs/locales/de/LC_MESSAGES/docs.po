"Apart from the values above, you can also configure the handling of groups and "

"identity provider to expose the groups in the identity token, please refer to "
"the documentation of your identity provider for more information. It may also "
"be neccessary to request an additional scope from the identity provider, e.g. "
"``groups``. Append this scope to the ``scopes`` setting if required. To enable "
"the functionality, you need to provide the name of the claim that contains the "
"group information. For example, if your identity provider exposes the groups in "
"a claim called ``groups``, you would enter ``groups`` there. You can also "
"access nested claims by using a dot-separated path, e.g. "
"``extra_information.groups`` if the group list is situated inside an "
"``extra_information`` dict in the identity token. The value of the claim must "
"be a list of strings, where each string is the name of a group in ephios (case-"
"insensitive). The user will be a member of all groups that are listed in the "
"claim, meaning they will be removed from groups that they have been manually "
"assigned to in ephios and that are not listed in the claim. Default groups (if "
"configured as described below) will be added to the user in addition to the "
"groups from the claim. By default, any groups from the claim that do not exist "

Configuration options
=====================

Ephios is configured via environment variables. Its often easiest to create a `.env` file and point ephios to it
via the `ENV_PATH` environment variable.

Most variables have a corresponding django setting.
See the `django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/>`__
for a more in-depth explanation of what they do.

.. _env_file_options:

The following variables are available (plugins and some niche features might require additional environment variables).

Setup
-----

`ENV_PATH`:
    Path to an environment file. Defaults to `.env` in the location of the ephios package.
    We recommend setting most of the following variables in this file.

`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`:
    Defaults to `ephios.settings`. If you want to use your own settings file,
    set this to the path to your settings file. This variable cannot be set in the environment file.

Debugging
---------

`DEBUG`:
    **Required**. Set to `True` to enable debug mode. Must be `False` in production.

`DEBUG_TOOLBAR`:
    Set to `True` to enable the django debug toolbar. Must be `False` in production.
    Defaults to `False`.

`INTERNAL_IPS`:
    Comma-separated list of IP addresses that are allowed to access the debug toolbar.
    Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.

Secrets
-------

`SECRET_KEY`:
    **Important**. Django secret key used to encrypt session data and other sensitive information.
    Defaults to a random value persisted into `PRIVATE_DIR/.secret`.

`VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`:
    Path to the private key used to sign web push notifications. If not provided, web push notifications wont work
    on some platforms. See :ref:`web_push_notifications` for details.
    Defaults to `PRIVATE_DIR/vapid_key.pem`. A keypair is automatically generated if it does not exist.

Data storage and Logging
------------------------

`DATA_DIR`:
    **Important**. Base path where ephios defaults to store files.
    Defaults to a `data` folder in the location of the ephios package,
    which is not recommended for production use.

`PUBLIC_DIR`:
    Path where public files are stored. Defaults to `DATA_DIR/public`.

`STATIC_ROOT`:
    Path where static files (css/js) are collected to.
    A reverse proxy should be configured to serve them at `STATIC_URL`.
    Defaults to `PUBLIC_DIR/static`.

`PRIVATE_DIR`:
    Path where private files are stored. Defaults to `DATA_DIR/private`.
    Make sure access to this folder is restricted to the user running ephios.

`MEDIA_ROOT`:
    Path where uploaded files are stored.
    Defaults to `PRIVATE_DIR/media`.
    You should backup this folder regularly.

`LOG_DIR`:
    Path to the folder where log files are put. Files inside are rotated daily.
    Defaults to `PRIVATE_DIR/logs`.

`LOGGING_BACKUP_DAYS`:
    Number of days to keep log files. Defaults to 14.


Database and Caching
--------------------

`DATABASE_URL`:
    **Required**. URL to the database. See
    `django-environ <https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#environ-env-db-url>`__ for details.

`CONN_MAX_AGE`:
    Number of seconds to keep database connections open. Defaults to 0, meaning connections are closed after each request.
    Refer to the `django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/databases/#persistent-database-connections>`__ for details.

`CACHE_URL`:
    URL to the cache. We recommend redis. See
    `django-environ <https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#environ-env-cache-url>`__ for details.

URLs and Routing
----------------

`ALLOWED_HOSTS`:
    **Required**. Comma-separated list of hostnames that are allowed to access the ephios instance.


`SITE_URL`:
    **Required**. URL used to construct absolute URLs in emails and other places.

`STATIC_URL`:
    URL where the static files can be found by browsers.
    Defaults to ``/static/``, meaning they are served by the same host.

Security
--------


`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`:
    Number of seconds to set the `Strict-Transport-Security <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security>`__
    header to. Defaults to the amount of seconds in 1 day, but should be set to a higher value in production.

`SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`:
    Include subdomains in the `Strict-Transport-Security <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security>`__
    header. Defaults to `False`.

`SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD`:
    Set the `preload <https://hstspreload.org/>`__ flag in the `Strict-Transport-Security <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security>`__
    header. Defaults to `False`.

`TRUST_X_FORWARDED_PROTO`:
    ephios must be served over HTTPS in production. In some setups, ephios is behind a reverse proxy that terminates
    SSL connections and the Origin header is not set with a https scheme. In this case, the proxy can communicate
    the fact that the connection is secure by setting the
    `X-Forwarded-Proto <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto>`__ header.
    Then this setting must be set to `True`. See
    `django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER>`__
    for details. Defaults to `False`.

E-Mail
------

`EMAIL_URL`:
    **Required**. URL to the email smtp server. See
    `django-environ <https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#environ-env-email-url>`__ for details.

`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`:
    **Required**. Email address that is used as the sender for all
    emails sent by ephios. (`Django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#default-from-email>`__)

`SERVER_EMAIL`:
    **Required**. Email address that is used as the sender for all
    error emails sent by django. (`Django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#server-email>`__)

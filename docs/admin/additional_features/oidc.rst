SSO / OIDC client
=================

Apart from creating local user accounts, you can also use external identity providers to authenticate your users. This is done by using the OpenID Connect protocol (OIDC), which is built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. This guide will show you how to configure your application to use an external OIDC provider to authenticate your users.

Prerequisites
-------------
You need to have an OIDC provider that you can use. OIDC support is built into a lot of identity providers, but you can also use a dedicated OIDC provider like `Keycloak <https://www.keycloak.org/>`_.
You also need to register a client with your OIDC provider. This client will be used by your application to authenticate with the OIDC provider. The exact steps to do this will vary depending on your OIDC provider, but you will need to provide the following information:

============ ===============================================
Redirect URI https://your-ephios-instance.com/oidc/callback/
============ ===============================================

You will also need to know the following information about your OIDC provider:

============================== ===============================================
Value                          Usual value
============================== ===============================================
client id                      *displayed after OIDC client registration*
client secret                  *displayed after OIDC client registration*
============================== ===============================================

Configuration
-------------

To configure your ephios instance, head to Settings -> Identity Providers and add a new OIDC provider.
You are then asked to provide the base url of your identity provider. This is the url that is used to access the OIDC endpoints and depends on your provider.
For example, if you are using Keycloak, this would be ``https://your-keycloak-instance.com/realms/your-realm``.
If your provider supports auto-discovery, we will automatically fetch the required information from the OIDC provider.
Otherwise, you will need to provide the following information:

============================== ===============================================
Value                          Usual value
============================== ===============================================
AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT         https://your-oidc-provider.com/auth
TOKEN_ENDPOINT                 https://your-oidc-provider.com/token
USERINFO_ENDPOINT              https://your-oidc-provider.com/me
JWKS_URI                       https://your-oidc-provider.com/certs
============================== ===============================================

The following additional configuration options are available:

============================== ==================================================== ========================
Value                          Usage                                                Default value
============================== ==================================================== ========================
scopes                         Scopes to request from the IDP (for additional data) ``openid profile email``
end_session_endpoint           redirect the user to the logout page of the IDP      None (no redirect)
============================== ==================================================== ========================

Apart from the values above, you can also configure the handling of groups for each identity provider.
If your identity providers supports exposing groups in the identity token, ephios can use this information to automatically assign users to groups.
You may be required to configure your identity provider to expose the groups in the identity token, please refer to the documentation of your identity provider for more information.
It may also be neccessary to request an additional scope from the identity provider, e.g. ``groups``. Append this scope to the ``scopes`` setting if required.
To enable the functionality, you need to provide the name of the claim that contains the group information.
For example, if your identity provider exposes the groups in a claim called ``groups``, you would enter ``groups`` there.
You can also access nested claims by using a dot-separated path, e.g. ``extra_information.groups`` if the group list is situated inside an ``extra_information`` dict in the identity token.
The value of the claim must be a list of strings, where each string is the name of a group in ephios (case-insensitive).
The user will be a member of all groups that are listed in the claim, meaning they will be removed from groups that they have been manually assigned to in ephios and that are not listed in the claim.
Default groups (if configured as described below) will be added to the user in addition to the groups from the claim.
By default, any groups from the claim that do not exist in ephios will be ignored. You can change this behaviour by activating the ``create missing groups`` setting.

If your identity provider does not expose the groups in the identity token, you can still assign users to groups by using the ``default groups`` setting.
All users that log in using this identity provider will be added to the groups listed there. Existing group memberships will not be altered.

If users are logged in exclusively using identity providers, you can also hide the local login form with the appropriate settings under "ephios instance".

.. warning::
    ephios uses the email adress provided by the IDP to identify a user account. If the IDP allows the user to change their email adress,
    users could enter the email adress of another user and log in as that user. To prevent this, you should configure your IDP to not allow users to change their email adress.

Usage
-----
After you configured at least one identity providers, the login page will display a button for each identity provider.
Clicking on this button will redirect you to the OIDC provider, where you can log in.
To log in with a local user account when the login form is hidden, you can still do so by navigating to ``/accounts/login/?local=true``.
